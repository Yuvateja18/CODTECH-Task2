### Project: PYTHON PROGRAMMING INTERNSHIP TASKS 

### Objective
To creating a Python program to calculate grades, the main objectives are to input student marks, determine the corresponding grade, and display the result.


### Key Activities

- **Input Marks** : The program should interact with the user and prompt them to input the student’s marks (usually on a scale of 0 to 100).Validating the input to ensure it falls within the acceptable range (0-100) is crucial.
- **Determine Grade** : Based on the entered marks, the program needs to compare them against predefined grade boundaries.
Typically, these grade boundaries divide the entire range of possible marks into segments, each representing a specific grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F).
- **Display Result** : Finally, the program should display the calculated grade to the user.


### Technologies Used

- **Python Programming Language** : Python is the primary technology here. It’s a versatile, high-level language known for its readability and ease of use. Python allows you to express complex logic in a concise manner.
- **Conditional Statements (if-elif-else)** : You’ll use conditional statements to determine which operation the user wants to perform (based on their input).
For instance, if the user selects “1,” you’ll call the addition function; if they select “2,” you’ll call the subtraction function, and so on.
- **User Input Handling** : To interact with the user, you’ll use Python’s built-in input() function. This function reads input from the user via the command line.
